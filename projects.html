                    <p>This interactive piece seeks to display the nutritional value of the American
                        meal in a meaningful, unique format. The project addresses the difficulties
                        of redesigning information on a topic (health) that is scrutinized constantly.
                        It demonstrates the art of drawing the eye to certain words and places
                        in a video, and many other visual techniques that emphasize healthiness.</p>
