        <h4>A Motion Design Project</h4>
        <p>This interactive piece seeks to display the nutritional value of the American meal in a meaningful,
        unique format. The project addresses the difficulties of redesigning information on a topic (health)
        that is scrutinized constantly.  It demonstrates the art of drawing the eye to certain words and places
        in a video, and many other visual techniques that emphasize healthiness. </p>
